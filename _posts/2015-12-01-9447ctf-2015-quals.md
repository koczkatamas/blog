*This challenge was solved by and the write up was written by one of my teammates, nguyen.*

There are 10 rounds, some round did manually, ex: round1 is rot-N subs ; round2 is a tranposition ; round3->5 can be cracked using round1 approach; ... 

The flag was

# Fibbed

The task was to crack Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol in a group where elements correspond to Fibonacci numbers.

The base element was the 2-by-2 matrix `[[0,1],[1,1]]`, and the group was what this base generates over a finite field of a given prime order.

All elements of this group have the form `[[a,b],[b,a+b]]`, so the public keys (the group elements) were represented by (a,b) pairs, the private keys were represented with the exponent.

I simply used the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step> algorithm to compute the discrete logarithm of the server's public keys.

I needed a hash table with 900 million elements in order to do so, and had to use 128-bit arithmetics for internal computations, but these are not a problem on x64 Linux if you have 64 GB RAM.

The program below used 49 GB RAM and ran for about 20 minutes on a single core.

After finding the private key of the server, the following python script printed the flag.

# calcpop
*This challenge was solved by and the write up was written by one of my teammates, nguyen.*

It was a simple buffer overflow vulnerability.

The flag was

{% highlight text %}
9447{shELl_i5_easIEr_thaN_ca1c}
{% endhighlight %}

# calpop reloaded
*This challenge was solved by and the write up was written by one of my teammates, nguyen.*

Steps to solve the challenge:

* set environment for calc_reloaded with RedOS package
* got EIP control and arbitrary code execution in calc_reloaded
* make shellcode for this OS
* use getdirent syscall to find that out name of flag file `Mes5 wi+h the b3st, d1e l1k3 the rest`

The flag was

# cards
*This challenge was solved by and the write up was written by one of my teammates, nguyen.*

Steps to solve the challenge:

* get .text address in stack after play game
* send payload to leak one of these address
* send payload to corrupt return address in stack 
* make it to return to printFlag

The flag was

# BWS
*This challenge was solved by and the write up was written by one of my teammates, nguyen.*

The vulnerability was in the URL parsing function. If you passed /../ as an URL it could read before the output buffer until the next "/" character.

The exploit code was:

{% highlight python %}

We had to find a few locations by their Google Street View images. After finding the exact locations, we had to collect the directions where the little man looked.

These are the URL of the Google Street View images and directions which gave us the flag (the text of the URLs are places which they depict or which could be identified the easiest):

# binned

# gife up now

This was an animgif with a lot of QR codes.

The QR codes contained words multiple times. 

The occurence count of the words gave us the following sequence:

{% highlight text %}
1,4,3,4,4,4,1,4,3,4,3,4,4,4,1,4,3,4,4,4,1,4,5,4,4,4
{% endhighlight %}

The QR code text contained the hint for the challenge: 

> two parts, all lower, add 9447{ to start and } to the end, first looks like "7do", cut off 450ms, second like <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xxTkB5bGy4> like faucet script

The delay between some frames was 400ms, and 500ms for others. Interpreting this as morse code (500ms = -, 400ms = .) gives us this sequence:

{% highlight text %}
-..-----...-..--------...-..-----...-..-----...-..--------...-..--------...-..--------...
{% endhighlight %}

Although we did not know where were the pauses, we could use the fact from the hint that the alphabet only contained "7do" characters.

{% highlight text %}
7 = −−•••
d = −••
o = −−−
{% endhighlight %}

This gave us the following form:

{% highlight text %}
-.. --- --... -.. --- --- --... -.. --- --... -.. --- --... -.. --- --- --... -.. --- --- --... -.. --- --- --...
{% endhighlight %}

Which was translated to ASCII from morse:

{% highlight text %}
DO7DOO7DO7DO7DOO7DOO7DOO7
{% endhighlight %}

The second part of the hint suggested that we should use [Tap code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_code):

{% highlight text %}
. ....  ... ....  .... ....  . ....  ... ....  ... ....  .... ....  . ....  ... ....  .... ....  . ....  ..... ....  .... ....
{% endhighlight %}

Which translates to:

{% highlight text %}
dotdootdotdyt
{% endhighlight %}

The final flag was:

{% highlight text %}
9447{do7doo7do7do7doo7doo7doo7dotdootdotdyt}

# sanutf8y_check

The challenge description gave us the following website: [http://sanutf8y-check-n2wisexx.9447.plumbing](http://sanutf8y-check-n2wisexx.9447.plumbing) which contained the flag with unicode characters. Writing them down with normal ASCII characters gave us the flag the scoreboard accepted.

# YWS

Sending `GET /.. HTTP/1.1` with nc listed the file names from the parent directory (outside files), and one of the directory names was the flag.

# premonition

The vulnerability was an SQL injection in the operator string.

Error text leaked, from which I saw spaces were removed (also I had to send a valid user-agent).

I solved the problem with a boolean-based technique (it could be solved much easier though). First I get the table names and found the `s3ekr17_passwords` table.

Then requested the contents of it. It was an (userid, password) tuple, where the password was only one character from the flag and the userid was the position of the character in the string.

A part of my solver code:

{% highlight csharp %}

        return false;
