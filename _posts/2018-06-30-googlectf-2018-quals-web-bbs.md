Last weekend I played on the Google CTF 2018 Quals which was one of the best CTFs I played recently. They separated the easy challenges into a "beginner's quest" so we got only the medium-hard ones. I think this was a really good choice and made the whole CTF experience more pleasant. Also as with other CTFs, changing to dynamic scoring was also a welcomed change.

I started solving all the web challenges as our web guy was missing on Saturday and nobody else is really into web, and as I am kind of a jack of all trades when comes to CTFs, I looked into the web challenges. At the end (I mean at the _really_ end but I will talk about this later) we solved all the web challenges, including BBS which was only solved 3 teams at the end of the CTF.

# Introduction to the challenge

BBS was... well... a BBS ([wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system)) in a form of really old school website.
