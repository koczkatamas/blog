*This challenge was solved by and the write up was written by one of my teammates, AKG and me* 

First of all we found the mbti page (mbti.asis-ctf.ir) in the pcap file (ClientHello sent the host name to support SNI - Server Name Identification), which was a simple [Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) (each question with 4 answers).

We found out that the text in the question depends on the previous answer, and the length of the texts differ.

After this we collected the data lengths from the pcap file (with scapy) and the questions lengths for each question-previous answer pairs (manually) and used some statistics to find out what the answers the candidate provided.

We had to install the [scapy-ssl_tls plugin](https://github.com/tintinweb/scapy-ssl_tls).

With this command we converted the pcap content to a more easily parsable text document:
{% highlight python %}
open('mbti.txt','w').write('\n'.join([x.command() for x in rdpcap('mbti.pcap')]));
{% endhighlight %}

And then filtered for the response packet lengths (in C# this time):

{% highlight csharp %}
var vals = File.ReadLines(@"mbti.txt").Where(x => x.Contains("dst='192.168.110.13'") && x.Contains("content_type=23")).
    Select(x => Regex.Match(x, @"TLSRecord\(length=(\d+)").Groups[1].Value).Where(x => !String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x)).Select(x => int.Parse(x)).ToArray();

var valsRev = File.ReadLines(@"mbti.txt").Where(x => x.Contains("src='192.168.110.13'") && x.Contains("content_type=23")).
    Select(x => Regex.Match(x, @"TLSRecord\(length=(\d+)").Groups[1].Value).Where(x => !String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x)).Select(x => int.Parse(x)).ToArray();

var data = Enumerable.Range(0, vals.Length).Select(idx => new { idx, requestLen = valsRev[idx], responseLen = vals[idx] }).ToArray();
var respLens = new[] { 1635 }.Concat(data.Where(x => x.requestLen == 628).Select(x => x.responseLen).Take(24).ToArray());

var respMin = respLens.Min();
var respMax = respLens.Max();
var respPerc = respLens.Select(x => (double)(x - respMin) / (respMax - respMin)).ToArray();

var questions = File.ReadAllLines(@"mbti_path.txt").Select(x => Regex.Match(x, @"Q(\d+)A(\d+) = (.*)")).
    Select(m => new QuestionData { Q = int.Parse(m.Groups[1].Value), A = int.Parse(m.Groups[2].Value), Text = m.Groups[3].Value }).ToArray();

foreach (var q in questions)
    q.Text = q.Q + " " + q.Text;

var textMin = questions.Min(x => x.Text.Length);
var textMax = questions.Max(x => x.Text.Length);

foreach (var q in questions)
{
    q.Len = q.Text.Length;
    q.Perc = (double)(q.Len - textMin) / (textMax - textMin) / 0.795;
}

var searcher = questions.GroupBy(x => x.Q).Select((x, i) => new { Q = x.First().Q, good = respPerc[i], choices = x.ToArray() }).ToArray();
var searcherStr = String.Join("\r\n\r\n", searcher.Select(x => "Question #" + x.Q + " => " + x.good.ToString("0.0000") + "\r\n" + String.Join("\r\n", x.choices.Select(y => "[ ] " + y.ToString()))));
var answer = String.Join("", searcher.Select(x => x.choices.OrderBy(y => Math.Abs(y.Perc - x.good)).First().A));
{% endhighlight %}

This file contains the 100 questions and to path to reach them: [mbti_path.txt]({{ site.url }}/images/asis2015finals/mbti_path.txt)

This generated the template of following output:

 - Question #0 is the answer to the age question (your name does not matter)
 - The number after the question if the relative length of the response found in the pcap
 - The "P" values of the answers are the calculated relative lengths of that answer
 - The smaller the difference between the two numbers the more likely that that answer was choosen

As you can see in the most cases the answer was obvious, but we wasn't sure about question #12 (there were 2 possibilities with the same 0.9177% relative length) and of course we didn't know the answer to the last question. 

This left us with 2 * 4 = 8 possibilities, which we tried out by hand:

{% highlight text %}
First number is the answer to the question #12, second number is the answer to the last question.

00 - ASIS{d9df3ae429c782e3323e3f9ae2a5d931} - incorrect
01 - ASIS{7c435d15918d509985b6889201af96ac} - incorrect
